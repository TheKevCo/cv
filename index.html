                <p>Prior to my career with Sysmex, my interest led me into Medical Technology. A field where I applied
        myself deep into the studies of the cellular world and how it all works to keep us going every day. Having a
        great deal of drive, energy and embracing challenges, I found myself in a position as a Medical Laboratory
        Scientist. All my tasks throughout the day made a meaningful impact on a patient's health and outcome.
        During this time, I took my Hematology ASCP certification to solidify my foot into this career.
        I am not afraid to take risks and as a result along with passion and ambition for learning and
        expanding I ventured into the wide world of Technology where I decided to make the switch over
        to the Service Engineer field with Sysmex. Outside of my work, I am currently partaking in a coding bootcamp
                    called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">"100 Days of Code"</a>  taught by Dr. Angela Yu.</p></td>
